// GraphQL is used for implementing the interfaces servers offers for browsers, and in general the integration between different applications on the web.
// The main principle of GraphQL is that the code on the browsers form a 'query' describing the data we wanted, and sends it to the API with an HTTP POST request.
// All GraphQL queries are POST requests
// GraphQL needs a schema, which describes the data sent between the client and the server
// Fields marked with exclamation mark must be given a value
// Every GraphQL schema describes a Query, which tells what kind of queries can be made to the API
// GraphQL describes only the data moving between the server and the client
// On the database/server, the data can be organized in any way.
